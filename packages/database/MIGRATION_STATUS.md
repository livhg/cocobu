# Database Migration Status

## ‚úÖ Completed

1. **Migration SQL Created**: `prisma/migrations/20251028_init/migration.sql`
   - All 10 tables defined: users, books, memberships, entries, splits, allocations, settlements, categories, magic_link_tokens, rate_limits
   - All indexes and foreign keys included
   - MySQL-specific syntax with utf8mb4 collation

2. **Migration Lock File**: `prisma/migrations/migration_lock.toml`
   - Provider set to MySQL

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Blocked (Network Restriction)

**Prisma Client Generation** - Cannot download Prisma engines due to 403 Forbidden errors from binaries.prisma.sh

## üîÑ Next Steps

### Option 1: Apply via Railway (Recommended)

If your Railway MySQL is already connected:

```bash
# Set your DATABASE_URL (get from Railway dashboard)
export DATABASE_URL="mysql://user:pass@host:port/database"

# Apply migration
cd packages/database
npm run migrate:deploy

# Generate Prisma client (if network allows)
npm run generate
```

### Option 2: Apply via Railway CLI

```bash
# Link to your Railway project
railway link

# Run migration in Railway environment
railway run npm run db:migrate:deploy -w @cocobu/database

# Generate client
railway run npm run db:generate -w @cocobu/database
```

### Option 3: Manual Application

If you have direct MySQL access:

```bash
mysql -h <host> -u <user> -p<password> <database> < prisma/migrations/20251028_init/migration.sql
```

## Verification

After applying migration, verify with:

```sql
SHOW TABLES;
-- Should show: users, books, memberships, entries, splits, allocations,
--              settlements, categories, magic_link_tokens, rate_limits,
--              _prisma_migrations

SELECT * FROM _prisma_migrations;
-- Should show one row for migration: 20251028_init
```

## Build Requirement

Before building the `@cocobu/database` package or `@cocobu/api` app:
1. Migration must be applied to database
2. Prisma client must be generated
3. Both must succeed before TypeScript compilation

## Current Schema Version

- Migration: `20251028_init`
- Schema: `packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma`
- Engine Type: `library` (WASM-based for environments with limited network)
