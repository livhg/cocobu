# Specification: CI/CD

## Overview
Defines continuous integration and deployment pipelines using GitHub Actions.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Automated Linting
The system SHALL automatically lint all code on every push and pull request.

**Rationale**: Catches code style violations and common errors early in the development process.

#### Scenario: Linting passes
- **GIVEN** a developer pushes code to GitHub
- **WHEN** the CI pipeline runs
- **THEN** ESLint SHALL check all TypeScript and JavaScript files
- **AND** the linting job SHALL pass if no violations exist
- **AND** the status SHALL be reported to the pull request

#### Scenario: Linting fails
- **GIVEN** a developer pushes code with linting violations
- **WHEN** the CI pipeline runs
- **THEN** ESLint SHALL report the violations
- **AND** the linting job SHALL fail
- **AND** the pull request SHALL be blocked from merging
- **AND** the errors SHALL be visible in the CI logs

### Requirement: Automated Type Checking
The system SHALL verify TypeScript compilation on every push and pull request.

**Rationale**: Ensures type safety across the entire codebase and catches type errors before runtime.

#### Scenario: Type checking passes
- **GIVEN** a developer pushes TypeScript code
- **WHEN** the CI pipeline runs
- **THEN** TypeScript SHALL compile all projects
- **AND** the type checking job SHALL pass if no errors exist
- **AND** the status SHALL be reported to the pull request

#### Scenario: Type checking fails
- **GIVEN** a developer pushes code with type errors
- **WHEN** the CI pipeline runs
- **THEN** TypeScript SHALL report the errors
- **AND** the type checking job SHALL fail
- **AND** the pull request SHALL be blocked from merging
- **AND** the specific type errors SHALL be visible in the CI logs

### Requirement: Automated Testing
The system SHALL run all tests on every push and pull request.

**Rationale**: Verifies code changes don't break existing functionality.

#### Scenario: Tests pass
- **GIVEN** a developer pushes code changes
- **WHEN** the CI pipeline runs tests
- **THEN** all unit and integration tests SHALL execute
- **AND** the test job SHALL pass if all tests succeed
- **AND** test coverage reports SHALL be generated

#### Scenario: Tests fail
- **GIVEN** a developer pushes code that breaks tests
- **WHEN** the CI pipeline runs
- **THEN** the failing tests SHALL be identified
- **AND** the test job SHALL fail
- **AND** the pull request SHALL be blocked from merging
- **AND** failure details SHALL be visible in the CI logs

### Requirement: Database Migration Validation
The system SHALL validate Prisma migrations on every push and pull request.

**Rationale**: Prevents schema drift and ensures migrations are valid before deployment.

#### Scenario: Migrations are valid
- **GIVEN** a developer adds or modifies Prisma schema
- **WHEN** the CI pipeline runs
- **THEN** Prisma SHALL validate the schema syntax
- **AND** Prisma SHALL check for migration conflicts
- **AND** the validation job SHALL pass if everything is correct

#### Scenario: Schema is invalid
- **GIVEN** a developer has an invalid Prisma schema
- **WHEN** the CI pipeline runs
- **THEN** Prisma SHALL report the syntax errors
- **AND** the validation job SHALL fail
- **AND** the pull request SHALL be blocked from merging

### Requirement: Build Verification
The system SHALL verify that all apps build successfully on every push and pull request.

**Rationale**: Ensures code can be deployed without build failures in production.

#### Scenario: Build succeeds
- **GIVEN** a developer pushes code
- **WHEN** the CI pipeline runs the build job
- **THEN** the Next.js frontend SHALL build successfully
- **AND** the NestJS backend SHALL build successfully
- **AND** all packages SHALL compile
- **AND** the build artifacts SHALL be cached

#### Scenario: Build fails
- **GIVEN** a developer pushes code with build errors
- **WHEN** the CI pipeline runs
- **THEN** the build SHALL fail with specific error messages
- **AND** the pull request SHALL be blocked from merging
- **AND** the build logs SHALL indicate which package failed

### Requirement: Test Database Setup
The system SHALL provision PostgreSQL and Redis for CI test runs.

**Rationale**: Integration tests need real database instances to run properly.

#### Scenario: CI test services are started
- **GIVEN** the CI pipeline is running tests
- **WHEN** the test job starts
- **THEN** a PostgreSQL 15 container SHALL be started
- **AND** a Redis 7 container SHALL be started
- **AND** the services SHALL be accessible to test processes
- **AND** migrations SHALL be applied to the test database

#### Scenario: Tests use test database
- **GIVEN** integration tests are running
- **WHEN** tests interact with the database
- **THEN** data SHALL be written to the test PostgreSQL instance
- **AND** data SHALL NOT affect production or development databases
- **AND** the test database SHALL be destroyed after tests complete

### Requirement: Parallel Job Execution
The system SHALL run CI jobs in parallel when possible to minimize pipeline duration.

**Rationale**: Faster feedback loop for developers by running independent checks concurrently.

#### Scenario: Independent jobs run in parallel
- **GIVEN** a commit is pushed to GitHub
- **WHEN** the CI pipeline starts
- **THEN** linting, type checking, and testing jobs SHALL run concurrently
- **AND** none SHALL block the others from starting
- **AND** the total pipeline time SHALL be less than sequential execution

### Requirement: Status Checks
The system SHALL report CI status to pull requests for merge protection.

**Rationale**: Prevents merging code that fails quality checks.

#### Scenario: All checks pass
- **GIVEN** a pull request has passing CI jobs
- **WHEN** all jobs complete successfully
- **THEN** the pull request SHALL show green checkmarks
- **AND** the "Merge" button SHALL be enabled
- **AND** branch protection rules SHALL allow merging

#### Scenario: Any check fails
- **GIVEN** a pull request has at least one failing CI job
- **WHEN** the job completes
- **THEN** the pull request SHALL show red X marks
- **AND** the "Merge" button SHALL be disabled
- **AND** the developer SHALL need to fix issues and push again

### Requirement: Dependency Caching
The system SHALL cache npm dependencies to speed up CI runs.

**Rationale**: Reduces install time from minutes to seconds, speeding up the feedback loop.

#### Scenario: Cache is empty
- **GIVEN** no previous CI runs have cached dependencies
- **WHEN** the CI pipeline runs for the first time
- **THEN** npm dependencies SHALL be installed from registry
- **AND** node_modules SHALL be cached for future runs
- **AND** the cache key SHALL be based on package-lock.json

#### Scenario: Cache is hit
- **GIVEN** a previous CI run cached dependencies
- **WHEN** a new CI run starts with unchanged package-lock.json
- **THEN** dependencies SHALL be restored from cache
- **AND** `npm install` SHALL complete in seconds
- **AND** the pipeline SHALL complete faster

#### Scenario: Cache is invalidated
- **GIVEN** package-lock.json has changed
- **WHEN** the CI pipeline runs
- **THEN** the old cache SHALL be ignored
- **AND** fresh dependencies SHALL be installed
- **AND** a new cache SHALL be created

### Requirement: Pipeline Duration
The system SHALL complete the full CI pipeline in under 5 minutes.

**Rationale**: Fast feedback is critical for developer productivity.

#### Scenario: Standard pull request
- **GIVEN** a typical code change is pushed
- **WHEN** the full CI pipeline runs
- **THEN** all jobs SHALL complete within 5 minutes
- **AND** the developer SHALL receive timely feedback

### Requirement: Security Scanning
The system SHALL check for security vulnerabilities in dependencies.

**Rationale**: Identifies known vulnerabilities before they reach production.

#### Scenario: No vulnerabilities found
- **GIVEN** all dependencies are secure
- **WHEN** the security scan runs
- **THEN** `npm audit` SHALL report zero vulnerabilities
- **AND** the job SHALL pass

#### Scenario: Vulnerabilities are found
- **GIVEN** a dependency has a known vulnerability
- **WHEN** the security scan runs
- **THEN** `npm audit` SHALL report the vulnerability
- **AND** the job SHALL fail if severity is high or critical
- **AND** the report SHALL indicate which package is vulnerable

### Requirement: Deployment Readiness Check
The system SHALL verify deployment prerequisites before allowing production deploys.

**Rationale**: Ensures only properly tested and validated code reaches production.

#### Scenario: Code is ready for deployment
- **GIVEN** all CI checks pass on the main branch
- **WHEN** deployment is triggered
- **THEN** the deployment SHALL proceed
- **AND** the latest build artifacts SHALL be used

#### Scenario: Code is not ready for deployment
- **GIVEN** CI checks are failing on the main branch
- **WHEN** deployment is attempted
- **THEN** the deployment SHALL be blocked
- **AND** an error SHALL indicate which checks are failing
